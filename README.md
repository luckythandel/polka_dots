# Polka Dots

This is a repo to configure you Debian/Ubuntu/Arch system just like lucky's. Polka Dots setup the your entire system from external sources and your package manager's repos (apt/pacman).
Polka Dots will configure gnome, tmux, terminal(Tilix) and other things. it is recommanded to __keep the backup of your important files__ before you execute the `setup.sh`.
tmux configuration is really helpful, atleast for me.
